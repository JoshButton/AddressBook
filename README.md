<h3>BRIEF</h3>
Design a Java program to store an Address Book. The address book contains many contacts; a contact contains: name, surname, phone number, email of a person.
The package addressbook contains the empty class AddressBook: you have to implement the methods and use and extend the main method in the TestAddressBook class to test your code.
An object AddressBook has a name, and it is possible to add new contact given the contacts data. The method getContact() receive a number and returns the Contact object.
The method add(Contact c) allows adding an object Contact to the Address Book, while the method delete(String s) will delete the Contact with surname equal to s.
The method list() returns a string with a comma-separated list of the contacts.
The method search(String s) returns the first Contact containing the string s in name or surname fields.
The method searchAll(String s) returns the first Contact containing the string s in any of the contacts' fields.
